            "This is my second favorite picture of you. I know you prefer the other one where you're smiling more but I prefer this one because when you click on the live photo you can see that just before this picture was taken you were talking about how excited you were to eat your food. I really enjoy trying new food spots with you, you always pick good spots!",
            "The chicken place was a little disappointing but I still really love this picture. I like the way the lighting is reflecting off of the CDs and onto you. You have such a great smile.",
            "Yummmm hot chocolate 😋 I can't believe we're halfway through watching stranger things!! You're such a funny person and have so many interesting thoughts so I always have fun when I'm around you.",
            "I love these photobooth pictures of us!! Even though the first ones were good too I think these more recent ones show how much more comfortable I've gotten around you. You make me feel so safe, and fine I guess you're right we need to take more pictrues together."
